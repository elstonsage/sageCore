Results for this test disagree with those of LODLINK 3.1.  There is one
informative phase-known meosis in this pedigree.  This is a non-recombinant
female meosis.

Adapting equation "0" in Cleves/Elston 1997 for this case gives a likelihood
ratio of 1.4000.  This is agrees exactly w. a LOD score of
.146128 calculated by the current program as opposed to that of .204120
calculated by LODLINK 3.1.
