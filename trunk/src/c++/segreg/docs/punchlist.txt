1.  Synchronization takes place in order of model members.
2.  Make one fixity parameter.
3.  Invalidate model if LSFBase* doesn't point to an analysis block.
4.  Change documentation to require user to spec. geno_freq. first.  Invalidate model
    if a geno_freq sub-block follows a transmission sub-block.
5.  Have user specify a single string to be used as root of  all ouput file names.
6.  Change names to var_prop_mean and std_prop_mean.  
    Mean sub-model must be parsed and constructed before variance sub-model.
    Variance sub-model must have a pointer to mean sub-model.
    Mean must be greater than some epsilon if one of these options chosen.
