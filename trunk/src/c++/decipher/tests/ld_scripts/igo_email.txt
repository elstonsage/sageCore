Howdy!  I've whittled my original LD-blocking script to a form that will 
merely find and report the LD blocks, based on the criterion that every 
pair of adjacent markers must have | D' | above a given threshold.

I've created a directory /home/rigo/for_dan/, that contains the script 
and a couple of sample files.  It contents are:

FIND_blox.pl:  Perl script
chr22_map.txt:  Sample Haploview map (info) file
chr22_ped.txt:  Sample Haploview data file

Of course, you'll need to copy these over to your home directory before 
using them.

To run Haploview and obtain a file containing | D' | values, enter the 
following command (on longitude or latitude) in the same directory as 
the chr22* files:

java -jar /home/rigo/software/Haploview.jar -n -pedfile chr22_ped.txt 
-info chr22_map.txt -hwcutoff 0 -maxDistance 5000 -check -dprime

This will generate an output file called chr22_ped.txt.LD, containing, 
for each pair of tested markers, the marker names, | D' |, LOD score for 
testing | D' | = 0, and some other stuff.  Note the lack of restriction 
for Hardy-Weinber equilibrium (-hwcutoff 0) and the 5 Mb max distance 
for comparisons (-maxDistance 5000; the default is 500 kb).

The Perl script takes as arguments (in order) the Haploview map file, 
the Haploview LD output file just created, and (optionally) the minimum 
| D' | and LOD score required to consider two markers in high LD.  
NOTE:  If you don't supply the minimum | D' | and LOD score, the script 
will default to a min. | D' | of 0.7 and LOD score of 0 (i.e., no LOD 
score requirement).

To run it on the sample files, the syntax is

FIND_blox.pl chr22_map.txt chr22_ped.txt.LD

If you want to specify a different minimum | D' | than 0.7, just add it 
as a third argument, and if you want to set a minimum LOD score, add it 
as a fourth argument.

The output is a text file called LDblox.out, which lists the markers in 
each block.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,

Rob
