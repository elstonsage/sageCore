Both subpopulations of population 1 were simulated to have with all
haplotypes being equally likely.

In population 2, one subpopulation was simulated with all haplotypes being
equally likely, while the other was simulated with 4 haplotypes having a
frequency of .13 and 4 haplotypes having a frequency of .12.
