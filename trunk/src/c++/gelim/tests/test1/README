This set of pedigrees tests various bits of the genotype elimination code. 
Primarily, it tests to make sure the genotype elimination works as intended
under a variety of circumstances:

Pedigree   Test
 1         Everything consistent, but certain members of the family are
           excluded on Trait T1
 2         Like above, but all members included.
 3         All markers inconsistent, single nuclear family inconsistencies
 4         All markers inconsistent, but 2 or more NF's are required to
           locate inconsistency.
