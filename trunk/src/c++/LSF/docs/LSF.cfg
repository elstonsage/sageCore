Things contained in {}s are optional.  ()* means zero or more of things
contained in the ().  ()+ means at least one.  | indicates or.  A \
preceding a ( or ) indicates that parenthesis is a character, not part of
the expression.

The following is a very left non-recursive CFG in EBNF for LSF variables. 
It can be converted into LALR or LL in this form, and with the addition of
semantic information most ambiguities disappear in actual usage.  The only
potential problem is a shift/reduce conflict due to the left associativity
of ']' in a LR parser scheme.  Also, it is assumed that the syntactic
pre-processing has correctly tokenized the input.  A more complete CFG would
include lexical parsing information as well.

VARIABLE ::= VAREXP ([VARIABLE])* {.VAREXP}
           | $VARIABLE 

// Protected variable expression (protected by order of operation)
VAREXP   ::= $\(VARIABLE\)
           | IDENTIFIER

IDENTIFIER = ALPHANUM(ALPHANUM | '-' | '_')*

ALPHANUM = alphanumeric character.

Variables evaluate to AttrVals.  Where used as part of a subexpression,
they are used as the appropriate attribute type (string or integer). 

Currently as implemented, identifiers are case sensitive for use as a
base.  Attribute names are not case sensitive.
