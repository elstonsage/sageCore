This test tests the filtration of RefMultiPedigree and FilteredMultipedigree data
structures into new FilteredMultipedigree.  To make it a reasonable test, primarily
of the specialized structural filters, a variety of test pedigrees are used.
The details of these test cases:

100 series: Single nuclear famly with a single offspring.  The second two
            digits of the pedigree name determines the number of people affected,
            with the first digit indicating number of parents, the second number
            of children (thus, 100, 101, 110, 111, 120, 121).  All cases checked.
200 series: Similar to 100 series, but with two offspring.  All options checked.
300 series: Cousin pair pedigree.  Tests done for no informative people (300),
            a pair of informative cousins (302), a grandparental pair (311), and 
            informative cousins with one informative grandparent (312).
402       : An informative half-sib pair.
500 series: Three tests involving a pedigree with an individual and their parents
            and grandparents.  Test1 is an informative mating pair (parents),
            Test2 is one grandparents and the unrelated parent, and test 3 is
            two unrelated (ie, not mated) grandparents.
602       : A single second cousin test.
701       : A complex pedigree with two, disjoint, informative sections.
801       : A pedigree with 10 3-sib nuclear families, all independent.  These
            10 each have different informativity options, with 0-3 sibs informative
            and 0-2 parents informative.  0 sibs informative is only checked in the
            case of two informative parents (thus only 10 options rather than 12)
900       : 8 person pedigree with a 2 sib nuclear family (both sibs informative),
            and four unconnecteds, 2 of which are informative.
            
We do the following tests:

RefMultiPedigree : Filter the above MP with filters for all members, informative 
                   members and structurally informative members (using the 
                   is_inf_within_subped functor).
RefPedigree      : Filter the above pedigrees with filters for all members, informative 
                   members and structurally informative members (using the 
                   is_inf_within_subped functor).
RefFamily        : Filter each family in the above pedigrees with filters for 
                   all members, informative members and family having an 
                   informative sibling pair (using the is_family_sib_pair_inf 
                   functor).
