This directory tests the reading in of x-linked markers under various
circumstances.  Specifically, it tests to see when invalid phenotypes
are given based upon individual sex.  There are five pedigrees in the
data set, each testing a particular set of circumstances:

1. Females
2. Males
3. Missing sex individuals
4. Missing sex individuals who can be inferred to be female
5. Missing sex individuals who can be inferred to be male
