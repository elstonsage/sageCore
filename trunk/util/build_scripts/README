This directory contains all the scripts used for building S.A.G.E. in an automated
way and testing that build.  They are used for automated nightly builds and also
to test merges and the like manually.

The primary script is known as diff_test.  This script runs make on the tree and
compares the output generated against platform-specific log files stored in the exp/
subdirectory.  With default arguments it does a standard release build, clearing
everything before building (necessary to avoid spurious diffs).  Alternatively,
a command line parameter can indicate what kind of build is to be performed.  
In our schema, this is used for running 'make testbuild' at present, though other
things could be used.  It returns a status indicator as to the success or failure.

source_test is a script similar to diff_test, in that it runs make on the SAGE
source, but it also runs the tests and stores test results in a second log file.
This log file is specifically generated for easy reading and being 
non-platform-specific.

Finally, install_test runs make_install on the directories, which copies the
compiled binaries into the SAGE/release/ directory, strips them and checks their
link dependencies.  For platforms for which volatiles are to be created, it installs
them as well.

The overall method of using this directory:

1.  Run diff_test (no arguments)
2.  Run diff_test testbuild
3.  Run source_test
4.  Run install_test

If all of these operations pass, the tree is considered good.

All other files in the directory are either used by this process (as in the files in
the exp/ directory).  Some are out of date (newexps, for example), and are left
in the hopes that someone will have time and inclination to improve the existing
system.
